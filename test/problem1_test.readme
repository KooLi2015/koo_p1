This is the testing document for project "problem1".
Before doing the tests, please ensure Python 3 are properly installed on your test machine.

Suppose project "problem1" is deployed under the path P1_HOME on your local filesystem.
The testing steps are listed as below:
I.  go to P1_HOME/test, and run the "problem1_test_createLargeInputFile.py" with the following arguments to create "problem1_test4.dat":
    >python problem1_test_createLargeInputFile.py problem1_test4.dat
    what should be shown on screen is like below:
    Successfully create problem1_test4.dat with 10000000 lines, and each line contain a float number 1.0！
    Note："problem1_test4.dat" is not packaged in current "problem1" project since it is very large and used for 
          large input file testing, so it is better to generate it at runtime according to step I.

II. go to P1_HOME/test, and run the "problem1_test.py" with the following arguments to run automation test against "problem1.py":
    >python problem1_test.py
    what will be shown on screen maybe like below:
    Finish Test1!   It costs 0.000304 seconds process time.
    Test1 Pass!
    Finish Test2!   It costs 0.000324 seconds process time.
    Test2 Pass!
    Finish Test3!   It costs 0.000282 seconds process time.
    Test3 Pass!
    Finish Test4!   It costs 22.778779 seconds process time.
    Test4 Pass!          
   

Note: 
For problem1, a simple automation test framework is implemented as above.
Currently, there are four test cases that cover various testing aspect of "problem1.py", which could be easily extended in the future.
The result of each test case together with its running time are included in the output.
Please refer to the comments of each test function within "problem1_test.py" for detailed info.
