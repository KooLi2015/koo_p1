"""Module for calculate the number of floating-point from an input file and their sum.
   According to https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#floating, 
   floating point literals are described by the following lexical definitions:
   floatnumber   ::=  pointfloat | exponentfloat
   pointfloat    ::=  [intpart] fraction | intpart "."
   exponentfloat ::=  (intpart | pointfloat) exponent
   intpart       ::=  digit+
   fraction      ::=  "." digit+
   exponent      ::=  ("e" | "E") ["+" | "-"] digit+
